## Projects

### Fine-Tuned Guardian Model with End-to-End API
[Repository](https://github.com/mkPuzon/Portfolio)

Developed and deployed a full-stack machine learning application to perform real-time sentiment analysis. This project involved wrapping a fine-tuned DistilBERT model , which achieved 95% accuracy, into a REST API using FastAPI. The entire application was containerized with Docker and deployed to the cloud, demonstrating a complete model-to-production workflow.

**Tech Stack**: Python, PyTorch, Transformers, FastAPI, Docker, Hugging Face Spaces.

**Skills**: End-to-End MLOps, API Development, Model Deployment, Containerization.

### AI Understanding, Research, and Analytic glossary for AI education
Designed and developed the backend for an AI powered self-updating glossary from cutting edge research on artificial intelligence. The AURA system scrapes research papers from a variety of AI subtoics, extracts key words and concepts, defines them within the contex of the paper, and integrates them into a PostgreSQL database.

## Research
### Building and Evaluating Deep Image Computable Neural Networks (OWLab)
Our goal was to better understand how brain area MSTd processes motion through building biologically informed computational models benchmarked on electrophysiological data.

- Collaborated closely with another student to design deep neural networks using a custom TensorFlow/Keras-based library.
- Experimented with input formats, preprocessing strategies, and introduced recurrence into different layers of DCNNs to evaluate the effects of temporal dynamics on neural alignment.
- Quantified neural alignment by comparing model neuron responses to MSTd neuron properties reported in prior studies on primates.

**Results**
- Identified the critical role of naturalistic input in achieving biological alignment.
- Demonstrated how recurrence at specific network stages improved motion perception model accuracy and biological plausibility.
- Presented research findings to a general audience at the Colby Undergraduate Summer Research Retreat (CUSRR).
- Contributed to results currently being prepared for publication with our faculty advisor.

This project advanced theoretical understanding of primate dorsal visual stream processing as well as shaped my interest in designing AI systems to better understand highly complex systems like the human brain.

### Heading Perception Experiment Design & Data Collection (OWLab)
Alongside the above core projects, I contributed to the design and execution of two motion perception experiments that expanded the OWLab’s datasets for human heading perception and object motion studies.
- Assisted with debugging and refining parameters in a MATLAB-based moving object perception experiment.
- Built off an existing Unity experiment framework to test follow-up hypotheses from initial heading perception work.
Results
- Produced rich datasets across 50+ participants, enabling further neural modeling research.
- Findings from these experiments are being developed into manuscripts.
  
Through this work I honed skills in experimental design while picking up new programming languages and research best practices.

### Adaptive Resonance Theory Machine Learning Model for Heading Prediction (OWLab)
I investigated adaptive resonance theory (ART) as a biologically inspired alternative to backpropagation in models learning to determine heading direction.

- Developed an ARTFLOW-based network yielding fully interpretable decision making without polysemanticity--a feature which renders certain backpropagation-based networks unexplainable.
- Benchmarked the ART model against human subjects under simulated optic flow conditions.
  
**Results**
- Achieved mean absolute error of 9.53° (horizontal) and 10.32° (vertical), surpassing human-level performance under analogous conditions.
- Demonstrated explainable, low-complexity learning compared to backpropagation-based models.

This work highlighted the value of interpretability in neural models, offering an alternative network architecture which prioritizes transparency and explainability with concrete technical performance improvements.

### RAG Research and Institution Tailored Application (Davis Insitute for Artificial Intelligence)
The majority of LLMs are designed to be generalists, but institutions often need specialized systems with access to secure, up-to-date information. Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) allows a model to access data from curated knowledge bases, reducing hallucinations and enabling source citation.
- Contributed to designing MuleBot, a Colby-specific RAG system providing accurate answers from internal databases.
- Helped collect, clean, and structure MuleBot’s knowledge base for reliable retrieval.
Results
- Improved MuleBot’s ability to provide Colby-specific information not found in public training data.
- Enabled faculty, staff, and students to access trustworthy institutional knowledge through a conversational interface.
This project demonstrated how LLMs can be responsibly customized to serve communities, balancing general-purpose capability with institution-specific accuracy.
