## Projects
### Deep Neural Network Library
[Repository](https://github.com/mkPuzon/Portfolio)

A large, modular library to build deep neural networks using the low level Keras API with a focus on performance. The project makes use of a flexible layer & block system to build, test, tweak, and assess models with ease. Additonally implements a variety of techniques in order to allow for deeper neural networks to run efficiently, including He weight intitialization, early stopping, regularization, batch normalization, dropout, learning rate decay, and more.
