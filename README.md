## Projects
### Deep Neural Network Library
[Repository](https://github.com/mkPuzon/Neural-Nets-Library)

A modular library to build deep neural networks using the functional Keras API with a focus on performance. The project makes use of a flexible layer & block system to build, test, tweak, and assess models with ease. Additonally implements a variety of techniques in order to allow for deeper neural networks to run efficiently, including a varity of weight intitialization methods, early stopping, regularization, batch normalization, learning rate decay, and more.

### Tool Calling AI Agents
[Repository](https://github.com/mkPuzon/Portfolio)

A personalizable assistant prototype utilizing a locally run language model with access to tools. The model currently has capabilities to schedule events in Google Calendar, check local weather, and give me personal remiders. Tools are highly customizable and written in Python.
